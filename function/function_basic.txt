Function:
    Function are resusable code blocks designed to perform a particular task.

Importance: 

1. Modularity of code:
        Functions in Programming help break down a program into smaller, manageable modules. 
        Each function can be developed, tested, and debugged independently, making the overall program more 
        organized and easier to understand.



        // Function to add two numbers
        function add(a, b) {
            return a + b;
        }
        ​
        function main() {
            // Call the add function with arguments 5 and 7
            var result = add(5, 7);
            // Output the result
            console.log("Sum: " + result);
        }
        ​
        // Run the main function
        main();

        Output
        Sum: 12

2. Abstraction:
        Functions in Programming allow programmers to abstract the details of a particular operation. 
        Instead of dealing with the entire implementation, a programmer can use a function with a clear 
        interface, relying on its functionality without needing to understand the internal complexities. 
        Functions hide the details of their operation, allowing the programmer to think at a higher level.



4. Readability and Maintainability:
        Well-designed functions enhance code readability by providing a clear structure and isolating specific tasks. 
        This makes it easier for programmers to understand and maintain the code, especially in larger projects 
        where complexity can be a challenge.

5. Testing and Debugging:
        Functions make testing and debugging much easier than large code blocks. 
        Since functions encapsulate specific functionalities, it is easier to isolate and test individual 
        units of code. Debugging becomes more focused on a specific function, simplifying the identification 
        and resolution of issues.

Parameter:

        function countLetterA(str) {
            ...
        }
        str is a parameter.

        Parameter = a variable that receives input when the function is called.

Returning Values from Functions:

        A function can return a value back to the code that called it.

        The return statement is used to send a value out of a function.

        The return Statement
        
        When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function stops executing.

        The value after return is sent back to the caller.

        Example
        function sayHello() {
        return "Hello World";
        }

        let message = sayHello();
        The variable message now contains the returned value.

        Returning a Calculated Value
        Most functions return the result of a calculation or operation.

        Example
        function multiply(a, b) {
        return a * b;
        }

        let result = multiply(4, 5);
        The returned value can be used anywhere a value is expected.

        Using Returned Values in Expressions
        You can use a function call inside another expression.

        Example
        function add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
        }

        let total = add(2, 3) * 10;
        Returning Text or Numbers
        A function can return any type of value, such as text or numbers.

        Example
        function fullName(firstName, lastName) {
        return firstName + " " + lastName;
        }

        fullName("John", "Doe");

Parameter Vs Argument: 

        ✅ Parameter

        Parameter = variable in the function definition

        function countLetterA(str) {
                    // ↑ parameter
        }


        str is a parameter.

        It is just a placeholder.
        It has no value yet.

        ✅ Argument

        Argument = actual value you pass when calling the function

        countLetterA("MarufA SAkiba");
                    // ↑ argument


        "MarufA SAkiba" is the argument.

Function return & store return value:

        return

        Sends a value from a function back to where it was called.

        Immediately stops the function.

        function add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
        }


        Store (set) the returned value in a variable

        let result = add(3, 5);   // result = 8


        Important rules

        return is for your program (logic).

        console.log() is only for displaying.

        If a function has no return, it returns undefined.

        function f() {
        console.log(10);
        }

        let x = f();   // x is undefined
