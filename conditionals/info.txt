JavaScript - Conditional Statements:

        JavaScript conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program based on given conditions.
        They control the flow of execution by running different code blocks depending on whether a condition is true or false.
    
    1.If-Statement:
        Executes code only when a specified condition is true.
        Useful for making simple decisions in a program.

        example:
        
        let x = 20;

        if (x % 2 === 0) {
            console.log("Even");
        }

        if (x % 2 !== 0) {
            console.log("Odd");
        };

    2.if-else Statement:
        
        Used when there are two possible outcomes.
        The else block runs when the if condition is not satisfied.

        example:

        let age = 25;

        if (age >= 18) {
            console.log("Adult")
        } else {
            console.log("Not an Adult")
        };
    
    3.else if Statement:
        
        Allows checking more than two conditions.
        Evaluated from top to bottom until a true condition is found.

        example:

        const x = 0;

        if (x > 0) {
            console.log("Positive.");
        } else if (x < 0) {
            console.log("Negative.");
        } else {
            console.log("Zero.");
        };

    4.Switch Statement:
            
            Used when one variable needs to be compared against multiple fixed values.
            Improves readability compared to long if...else if chains.

            example:

            const marks = 85;

            let Branch;

            switch (true) {
                case marks >= 90:
                    Branch = "Computer science engineering";
                    break;
                case marks >= 80:
                    Branch = "Mechanical engineering";
                    break;
                case marks >= 70:
                    Branch = "Chemical engineering";
                    break;
                case marks >= 60:
                    Branch = "Electronics and communication";
                    break;
                case marks >= 50:
                    Branch = "Civil engineering";
                    break;
                default:
                    Branch = "Bio technology";
                    break;
            }

            console.log(`Student Branch name is : ${Branch}`);

    5.Ternary Operator:
        
        A condition to test.
        An expression to evaluate if the condition is true.
        An expression to evaluate if the condition is false.

        Syntex:

        condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse

        example:

        let age = 21;

        const result =
            (age >= 18) ? "You are eligible to vote."
                : "You are not eligible to vote.";

        console.log(result);

    6.Nested if....else:

       Useful for handling complex decision-making logic.
       Deep nesting should be avoided to maintain code readability.

       example:

        let weather = "sunny";
        let temp = 25;

        if (weather === "sunny") {
            if (temp > 30) {
                console.log("It's a hot day!");
            } else if (temp > 20) {
                console.log("It's a warm day.");
            } else {
                console.log("It's a bit cool today.");
            }
        } else if (weather === "rainy") {
            console.log("Don't forget your umbrella!");
        } else {
            console.log("Check the weather forecast!");
        };
