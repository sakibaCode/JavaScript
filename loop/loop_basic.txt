Loop:
   Loops in JavaScript allow a block of code to run multiple times as long as a given condition is satisfied.
   They help reduce repetition and make programs more efficient and organized.


   1.for loop:
      The for loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times. 
      It contains initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in one line.

        Syntax

        for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {

             // Code to execute
        }

        1.1 for of loop 

        Directly gives values, not indexes

        Simpler and cleaner syntax

        Less chance of logical errors (no counter, no length issues)

        Works naturally with arrays, strings, maps, sets

        Improves readability (code looks closer to plain English)

        Best when you don’t need the index, only the data

        Handles iterables automatically

        let name = "Sakiba";

        for (let ch of name) {
            console.log(ch);
        }

        output: 
        S
        a
        k
        i
        b
        a



    2. while Loop
        The while loop executes as long as the condition is true. It can be thought of as a repeating if statement. 

            Syntax

            while (condition) {
                // Code to execute
            }

    3. do-while Loop
        The do-while loop is similar to while loop except it executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.

            Syntax

            do {
                // Code to execute
            } while (condition);
